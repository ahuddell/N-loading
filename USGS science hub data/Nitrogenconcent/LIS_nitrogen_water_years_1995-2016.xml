      <abstract>This U.S. Geological Survey data release presents tabular data on nitrogen concentrations and loads for multiple nitrogen species, and river discharge data used in the analysis of data collected from October 1994 to September 2016. Data on flow and nitrogen concentrations were analyzed using the USGS EGRET R package, and the method of WRTDS (Weighted Regression on Time Discharge and Season). 
Data and outputs summarized are for water-quality data collected from 18 water-quality monitoring stations in the Long Island Sound watershed. Specific data in tabular format for this release include: calculated annual nitrogen concentration and loads, calculated annual flow-normalized nitrogen concentrations and loads by water year (for sites with 20 years of data or more), and calculated annual seasonal loads of each nitrogen constituent by calendar year. Measured daily river discharge data and sampled nitrogen concentration data for each water-quality monitoring site are available as tables accessible within R statistical software.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data release provides information on the water-quality budget of nitrogen compounds in tributaries of Long Island Sound, in cooperation with researchers from the University of Connecticut.</purpose>

        <procdesc>For all except 2 sites (described in the next Process_Step), water-quality concentration and daily mean discharge data were retrieved from https://waterservices.usgs.gov/ through the use of the USGS R package dataRetrieval: https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval. The use of the package for this application is described in Hirsch, R.M., and De Cicco, L.A., 2015, User guide to Exploration and Graphics for RivEr Trends (EGRET) and dataRetrieval: R packages for hydrologic data (version 2.0, February 2015): U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods book 4, chap.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>For the site 01209710, Norwalk River at Winnipauk, Connecticut, daily river discharge data were downloaded from https://waterservices.usgs.gov/ through the use of the USGS R package dataRetrieval: https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval) from an upstream site (01209700, Norwalk River at South Wilton, Connecticut), and were multiplied by 1.10 as a correction for the 10 percent difference in drainage area.
For the site 01122610, Shetucket River at South Windham, Connecticut, daily discharge data were downloaded from from an upstream site (01122500, Shetucket River near Willimantic, Connecticut), and were multiplied by 1.01 as a correction for the difference in drainage area.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20171127</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Methods: Nitrogen loads were estimated using a weighted regression approach called Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) (Hirsch and others, 2010), which is included in the R software package called EGRET - Exploration and Graphics for River Trends (version 2.6.0) (Hirsch and DeCicco, 2015). The application of WRTDS to generate the results provided in Vlahos and others, 2020 (in review***).   Description of a previous use of this method in the Long Island Sound Watershed is given in Mullaney (2016).

Concentrations and loads were not estimated in WRTDS if greater than 50 percent of the water-quality concentration data were below (reported with a “&lt;” remark) the reporting limit. Output data on flow-normalized concentrations and loads were not estimated for sites with less than 20 years of water-quality records. Flow normalization is described in detail in Hirsch and others (2010).
